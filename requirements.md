# Capstone Project Guide

## Final Project: Show What You Know

### What is the Capstone Project?

This is your chance to build a full web application using everything you've learned. It’s not just about getting a grade — it’s about building something real, something that shows your skills, and something you’ll be proud to share with employers, friends, or even just yourself.

You’ll design it, develop it, and present it. You’ll walk away knowing that you built something start to finish — and that’s a big deal.

## Tech Stack Guidelines

| Layer    | Required                              | Notes                                |

## What You’ll Build

You can build whatever kind of app you want, as long as it has:

- A clear purpose or use case
- Good user experience — simple, functional, and responsive
- A working MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Optional: advanced features if time allows

**Some examples:**

- Affirmation app
- Journal app
- Budget tracker
- Job board
- Recipe collection
- Fitness planner
- Event RSVP tool

## MVP vs. Stretch Goals

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

This is the version of your app that covers the basics. It should include just enough to show that your idea works. If you can’t build this part, the project isn’t ready.

**Example:**

- A user can log in
- A user can create, read, update, and delete an item
- Pages are responsive

### Stretch Goals

These are the features you add once the basics are working. They’re optional, but they can make your project stand out.

**Examples:**

- Dark mode
- Filters or search
- File uploads
- Animations
- Real-time updates

## Submit a Proposal Before You Start

Before you begin coding, submit:

- A one- to two-sentence description of your app
- A list of MVP features
- Any stretch goals you're considering
- Your tech stack (React only or full-stack)
- Whether you’re working solo or with a team

## Timeline and Process

Over the next 12 days of class, you'll work through:

1. Planning and wireframing
2. Building out your frontend
3. Connecting your backend (if using one)
4. Styling and testing
5. Writing your documentation
6. Deploying your app
7. Giving a short final presentation

You'll have time in class to work, ask questions, and get help. I'll be here to support you, but this is your time to show what you can do when you're driving the project.

---

## Final Presentations

At the end of the capstone period, you’ll present your app to the class. It doesn’t need to be fancy — just clear and confident.

Your presentation should include:

- What your app is and what it does
- What tech you used
- What challenges you ran into and how you solved them
- A live walkthrough of the app

---

## Final Word

You’ve put in the work. Now it’s time to put it all together. Don’t compare yourself to anyone else — just focus on building something you’re proud of.

Be real. Be intentional. Build something that reflects your growth and your voice.
